# AX-12A Mechanical Frame

This is sort of my poor man's tachikoma.

### Leg Parts

<img src="pics/spider-anatomy.png" width="400px">

Part names are based off of a traditional 8 legged spider. Yes, this one only
has 4 legs, but the parts are expensive, so cut me some slack.

- Coxa: red
- Femur: blue
- Tibia: yellow
- Tarsus: green

Each of the legs has 4 addressable smart servos. Leg 1 for example, has servos 1,
2, 3, and 4. Each servo controls a degree of freedom for each leg.

## Assembled

The design below shows a new femur design where the part is curved. This
gives the robot a better leg orientation when in the stowed configuration
and the legs are up.

# Ideas

I saw [this](https://github.com/adammck/hexapod) design by Adam McKaig and
drew some ideas from it.

Also, I always thought the bugs from Starship Troopers were cool.
